								For this chapter, I chose the word "Design" as this chapter really dives deep into the design of things. 
								For example, if something so simple is poorly designed it may cause problems for the user. He introduced the term "Norman Doors", 
								doors in which are they are confusing to operate. The overall idea is that something so simple as a door, which has two functions, 
								to open and to close, can become a problematic concept if the design of the door is flawed in any way whatsoever.</p>

							<p>The word I will be choosing is "Scanning", which describes how users perceive things in their daily lives.

							<p>I related to the reading's discussion of "Signal vs. Noise Ratio" (SNR) in many ways. It makes me think of a crucial time in my career when I 
								organized a disorganized presentation. The presentation changed as a result of using SNR principlesâ€”removing unnecessary information, 
								concentrating on important ideas, and including an emotionally engaging story. The message was received and appreciated by the audience,
								 which had a positive result. This experience brought home how important SNR is to design and communication: clarity and engagement take
								  precedence over clutter. It's a lesson I've applied to my career, promoting clarity and proportion in efficient communication.</p>

							<p>As volume is to music, saturation is to color. The intensity of colors in a design or piece of artwork can produce a variety of visual effects 
								and express different meanings, just as the volume of a musical piece can provoke distinct emotions and set the mood. High saturation colors 
								can be energizing and attention-getting, much like a loud, passionate piece of music. On the other hand, low-volume gentle music can be calming,
								much as muted or pastel colors that produce a tranquil visual experience.
								<br>
								<br>
								Similar to how a musician might control the loudness to elicit the desired emotional response in their listeners, understanding the concept of 
								saturation aids in creating visual compositions that effectively communicate with and resonate with the target audience.</p>

						<div class="col-12">
							<p>There is more to color than meets the eye; it serves as a useful tool in design. As a designer, 
								I recognize that color has more uses than just aesthetic appeal. It can successfully convey ideas and feelings. 
								Choosing the appropriate colors for the task at hand is more important than learning color theory. 
								Colors define brand identities, set the mood for websites, and rationally guide consumers through designs. 
								Consider it as a designer's toolkit where we choose colors to produce images that appeal to the viewer. 
								In my professional life, I'm conscious of the fact that design is about having clear communication, and color is how we do that.</p>

						<h4>#WordJournal</h4>

					<div class="row">
						<div class="col-12">
							<p>I decided on the word "Navigation" since it encompasses a key idea covered in the reading. 
								Effective navigation skills are necessary for both the physical world of websites and the virtual world of malls.
								In my line of work, user experience (UX) design, where developing clear and user-friendly navigation is essential,
								it's important to keep in mind. Whether it's on a website or at a store, users should be able to quickly find what they need.
								Knowing the fundamentals of navigation enables me to create user interfaces that effectively direct users and improve their overall experience.<hr>

							<a href="#" class="image featured"><img src="images/apple.png" alt="" /></a>
							<p>Apple's color scheme can be seen as a harmonious combination, with white and black creating a strong contrast and gray serving as a transitional element between them.

								The color scheme of Apple conveys a sense of refinement, professionalism, and minimalism. 
								Users should perceive Apple goods as being svelte, contemporary, and dependable, according to the designers. 
								While sporadic splashes of red and green inject energy and hint at innovation, the combination of white, black, and gray produces a neutral and user-friendly workplace.


								
								<a href="#" class="image featured"><img src="images/airpods.png" alt="" /></a>
								<a href="#" class="image featured"><img src="images/bby.png" alt="" /></a>
								This version uses a contrasting color scheme with bright blue and vivid yellow to create a visually stimulating and lively mood. 
								Blue symbolizes trust and reliability, while yellow adds energy and optimism.
								<a href="#" class="image featured"><img src="images/gray.png" alt="" /></a>
								In this version, a combination of charcoal black and cool gray maintains a minimalist and professional atmosphere. 
								Silver accents add a touch of sophistication and highlight key elements effectively.
								<a href="#" class="image featured"><img src="images/red.png" alt="" /></a>
								This color scheme combines crimson red and vibrant green to create a fresh and dynamic mood. Red symbolizes passion and energy,
								 while green signifies growth and innovation.
								<br>
								<br>
								I think that using black and white keeps an minimlaistic look, which Apple tends to strive for, but having other colors will make the user
								stay engaged and look at the things they highlight.

						<h4>#DirectedAnalysis</h4>

					<div class="row">
						<div class="col-12">
							<p>The term "Responsive Layout" was introduced in the reading, highlighting the necessity for designs to adjust to shifting format sizes, 
								such as various screen sizes. I'll use a screenshot of a responsive web layout as an example to explain this notion.
								This is a good example for the guidelines, because the image shows the variation in layout depending on the device the user is using.

For user comprehension, readability elements like line height and letter spacing are crucial. A consistent and enjoyable user experience is made possible by a typographic scale and aesthetic harmony. My job as a designer depends on my ability to comprehend these linkages because they are the basis of clear design communication.

							<p>As headlines are to news items, taglines are to websites. A well-written tagline on a website's main page draws visitors' 
								attention and gives them a brief summary of what the website is about, much like a great headline does for readers, 
								who get a glimpse of the article's content. Just as a tagline should express the spirit of the website and attract visitors to investigate deeper, 
								a headline should be informed and intriguing. The objective is to captivate the audience and persuade them to learn more about the subject matter 
								in both situations.
								<br>
								This idea is key to keep in mind since, whether I'm designing websites or writing material, the ability to create compelling taglines
								 or headlines is essential for capturing visitors' attention and persuading them to pay attention to the main message.

								Feedback acts as a compass for designers, providing guidance, pointing out the appropriate path,

								 explorers through uncharted territory. Designers rely on feedback to influence their judgments 
								 and continuously improve their work, just like explorers do while navigating new terrain with a compass. 
								 This comparison highlights the value of feedback in design and how it relates to having a successful career.

							<p>I settled on the word "Visualization" because it perfectly sums up the main idea covered in the reading.
								 The technique of graphically portraying facts or information to make it easier to grasp and analyze is known as visualization. 
								 In my line of work, proficiency in producing powerful visualizations is essential, particularly in data analysis and user interface design. 
								 It facilitates the conveyance of difficult information to stakeholders and makes it more approachable and intuitive.

						<div class="col-12">
							<p> Ensuring the triangles in a triangle-based snake quilt fit perfectly is essential. 
								The triangles line up to create a smooth snake-like route. 
								This balance makes the snake's design aesthetically pleasing and harmonious.
								<br>
								To focus the viewer's gaze along the winding snake pattern, use of placement and direction of the triangular segments 
								guides the spectator through the snake's journey. 
								<br>
								The use of purple on the edges of the snake ensures the eyes maintain focus on the shape of the snake.
								The use of dark triangles on the border keeps the eyes focused center of the quilt.

								Like fuel propels a rocket into orbit, enthusiasm advances invention. Like a rocket won't launch without fuel, creative thinking stagnates in the absence of enthusiasm.
								 The drive and inspiration required to test out novel concepts, take chances, and eventually achieve greater levels of innovation and achievement come from enthusiasm. </p>
								<br>
								Because it emphasizes the critical role that excitement plays in fostering creativity, this idea is crucial for me to keep in mind as I pursue my job.
